# Lab 1: Set up your machine

[[toc]]

## Objective

Howdy all DevOps enthusiasts and soon to be one. In the next three hours (or ten depending on your skillset), you will be setting up your machine to be ready for Developing a website using **Django** (python framework) with **PostgreSQL** (SQL) in the popular and mature environment, **Linux**.

Of cause, building a web alone is boring. You will work together with your teammate via **GitHub**.

To get ready for your new journey, today we will achieve the following objectives.

[1. Setup your GitHub](#01-setup-your-github)

[2. Have accessible Linux environment](#02-have-accessible-linux-environment)

[3. Learn basic Terminal command](#03-learn-basic-terminal-command)

## Workshop 1. Setup your GitHub

For this task, at the end of the lab, your team should have 1 reposistory (own by any of your team member) and must have 1 commit from each of your team member.

### Task 1-A. Sign-up to GitHub.com

Go to [GitHub](www.github.com) and register github using your personal information. You can create this account as your personal account. You can even use it as your life portfolio to show off your developing skill.

Once you create your account using your personal email, you can add your academic email to get the benefit of GitHub Education.

```text
1. Navigate to GitHub.com
2. go to "setting"
3. On left hand side, go to "Emails"
4. Just add your st12xxxx.ait.asia
```

### Task 1-B. Create new reposistory

Before we create a reposistory, let's explore what and why we should do this.

#### Question: What is git?

> [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)
>
> Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).
  
In my word, GIT is a protocol. It is just a name. Just like when I say Python, it is just a programming language. The point of GIT is to do **version control** and **team colloborating**.

#### Question: What is version control?

> [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)
>
> Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

Imagine your friend promise to return 100 baht back to you. You create a Google Docs to record this promise and sign. A few days pass, you come back to the document and the return amount is changed to 10 baht. What would you do?

If you have set some sort of **version control** on your Google Docs, you would be able to track any changes to your document including Who change the doc, When the doc is modified, Where/Which line of content is changed. All of this is done automatically and efficiently in Git.

The basic **version control** you may have done your whole life is to save your work as

- *project_new*
- *project_current*
- *project_final*
- *project_final_final*
- *project_okay_im_done*

#### Question: What is GitHub?

> [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)
>
> GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration and wikis for every project.

Github = Youtube

You = youtube channel

Reposistory = Video

#### Question: What is reposistory?

> [Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/repository)
>
> Noun: a place where things are stored and can be found

It is a storage to hold/keep something. In GitHub, a bunch of document/file is expected to be stored in a reposistory.

### Task 1-C. Invite team member to your main reposistory

## Workshop 2. Have accessible Linux environment
