## What is Dynamic Website?

>[spiralytics](https://www.spiralytics.com/blog/what-are-dynamic-websites/)
> 
> A dynamic website is a website that displays different types of content every time a user views it. This display changes depending on a number of factors like viewer demographics, time of day, location, language settings, and so on.
>
> While static pages require manual updating before their contents change, dynamic websites offer unique content to visitors each time they view the site. This is done through a combination of client-side and server-side scripting.
>
> - **Client-side scripting** involves code that is executed by the viewer’s browser, using scripting languages like JavaScript. This scripting is responsible for rendering changes to the webpage as a response to actions taken within it, such as mouse clicks or keyboard use.
> - **Server-side scripting**, on the other hand, refers to code that is executed by the server before sending the content to the viewer’s browser. This affects the webpage when it is loaded or visited, like with login pages, submission forms, and shopping carts.
> 
> Using both types of scripting allows modern websites to adapt to each user’s view of the page while reducing the server’s load time.

A dynamic website has some level of programming involved. There are two kinds of this programming discriminate by where is the code runs, a **client-side code** and a **server-side code**. We will play around with this two kinds of code.
