If your team is doing a good job with code maintainability, the following are true:</p> <ul><li>It's easy for the team to find examples in the codebase, reuse other people's code, and change code maintained by other teams if necessary.</li> <li>It's easy for the team to add new dependencies to their project, and to migrate to a new version of a dependency.</li> <li>The team's dependencies are stable and rarely break the code.</li></ul> <p>These findings highlight the importance of making it easy for developers to find, reuse, and change code across the whole organization's codebase, and also of implementing practices and tools to help with dependency management.</p> <p>Code maintainability is a capability that requires organization-wide coordination, since it relies on being able to search, reuse, and change other teams' code. Managing dependencies effectively is often a major source of pain when working with large codebases and large organizations. Tooling that can help avoid problems with dependencies or illuminate the consequences of code changes can improve design decisions and code quality for all engineers, which in turn enables them to work faster and create more stable, reliable software.</p></blockquote> <p>From what we read, the issue is clearly shown when the project consists of multiple teams/devs and huge code base.</p> <blockquote><p>It is essential to adopt and evolve processes and tooling that make it easy for teams to consume known-good versions of dependencies and upgrade them rapidly, including automated <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-continuous-integration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">continuous integration (CI)<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-test-automation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">testing<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></strong> to discover if new versions of dependencies contain breaking changes), and to quickly and simply correlate the versions of dependencies in use with the systems that use them.</p></blockquote> <h2 id="continuous-integration-ci"><a href="#continuous-integration-ci" class="header-anchor">#</a> Continuous Integration (CI)</h2> <blockquote><p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/originalContinuousIntegration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Continuous Integration (original version) - https://martinfowler.com/<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></p> <p>The fundamental benefit of continuous integration is that it removes sessions where people spend time hunting bugs where one person's work has stepped on someone else's work without either person realizing what happened.

Continuous deployment is when teams try to deploy every code change to production as soon as possible. Continuous deployment works well for web services, but can't be applied to software such as firmware or mobile apps. Continuous delivery is applied to all kinds of software including firmware and mainframe systems, and in highly regulated environments. You can and should start with continuous delivery, even if you never intend to start using continuous deployment.</p> <p>Continuous delivery and continuous deployment are mistakenly viewed as risky and not suited to regulated or safety critical domains. In fact, the goal of continuous delivery is to reduce software risk, and DORA research has shown consistently that high performers achieve higher levels of reliability and availability. The technical practices that drive continuous delivery—continuous testing, shifting left on security, and comprehensive testing and observability—are even more important in highly regulated and safety-critical domains.

No one should be able to declare their work &quot;dev complete&quot; unless automated acceptance tests are passing.</li></ul></blockquote> <img src="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/images/ta-image1.png"> <p>Testing is an art of its own because testing can cover from Unit test to Userr Acceptance test (UAT) and system performace testing (Availability, Load/Stress). In this lab, to get a taste of CI/CD, we fous on Unit Tests. Many programming languages have at least one unit test library.</p> <h2 id="automation-tools"><a href="#automation-tools" class="header-anchor">#</a> Automation Tools</h2> <p>In the developing process/life cycle, there are task that are consider to be routine work such as Testing and Deploying. For testing, once the test script is created, it is just a matter of executing it regularly and ,in context of CI, as much as possible (the sooner the bug is detected, the better). For deploying, we could stick to the old <code>copy</code> the code and <code>restart</code> the service. Surely, deploying the app, especially web app, is mostly the same process every build. In term of CD, we want the deployment to be a convinence process. Automating deployment is what we are after.</p> <p>There are many automation tools. Let's explore the two well-known tools. Jenkins and GitHub Actions.</p> <h3 id="jenkins"><a href="#jenkins" class="header-anchor">#</a> Jenkins</h3> <blockquote><p><a href="https://www.jenkins.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.jenkins.io<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></p> <p>The leading open source automation server, Jenkins provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project.</p></blockquote> <h3 id="github-actions"><a href="#github-actions" class="header-anchor">#</a> GitHub Actions</h3> <blockquote><p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docs.github.com/en/actions<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></p> <p>Automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository with GitHub Actions.

Jenkins runs on your server but GitHub Actions runs on the Github environment. Therefore, GitHub Actions shares any privacy concern with other cloud/third-party services. In addition, any system related testing could be done directly with Jenkins (becuase it runs on your server).</p> <p>The following table summarized the differences between Jenkins and GitHub Actions.</p> <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/613/1*21yMc37a8sj0yC4OhZBh8w.png"> <p><a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/github-actions-or-jenkins-making-the-right-choice-for-you-9ac774684c8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ref<span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></a></p> <hr> <h2 id="what-are-we-doing-today"><a href="#what-are-we-doing-today" class="header-anchor">#</a> What are we doing today</h2> <p>Our objective today is the get a taste of CI/CD.
